      "Combine the current thenable with a provided promise and return an [[Term]] object that
        - resolves when both the current thenable and the other promise are resolved
        - rejects when the current thenable or the other promise is rejected
        
        The [[Term]] promise will be
        - resolved with a tuple of values of the original promises. It is important to notice that
          tuple elements are in reverse order of the and chain
        - rejected with the reason of the rejected promise
        
        The returned [[Term]] object allows for promise chaining as a fluent API:

            Promise<Integer> p2 = ...
            Promise<Boolean> p3 = ...
